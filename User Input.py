a = input("Enter your name -> ")  # Most basic form of user from input
print("My name is", a)

x = input("Enter first number = ")
y = input("Enter second number = ")
print(x+y)  # the result will be 12 because of string concatination
print(int(x)+int(y))  # Here due to type casting the str is converted into int so the ans is 3
